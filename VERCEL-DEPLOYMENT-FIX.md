# âœ… Vercel Deployment Issue Fixed

## Problem Resolved
- **Error:** "The `functions` property cannot be used in conjunction with the `builds` property"
- **Solution:** Removed conflicting `functions` property from vercel.json

## Updated Configuration

The `vercel.json` file has been cleaned up to use only the `builds` property, which is compatible with your Node.js Express application.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Use Current vercel.json
Your current `vercel.json` is now fixed and should deploy successfully.

### Option 2: Simple Configuration
If you still encounter issues, rename `vercel-simple.json` to `vercel.json`:
```bash
mv vercel-simple.json vercel.json
```

### Option 3: No Configuration File
Delete `vercel.json` entirely and let Vercel auto-detect your Node.js app:
```bash
rm vercel.json
```

## Environment Variables for Vercel

Add these in your Vercel dashboard:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
SESSION_SECRET=your_strong_session_secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Deploy Now

Your S.A.R.A. chatbot should now deploy successfully on Vercel without any configuration conflicts!
